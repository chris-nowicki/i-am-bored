## Overview
For this project I used [Bootsrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) to create the HTML and I used [The Bored API](https://theboredapi.com) as my first API to work with and connect to.

### What I learned

Playing around with Bootsrap is a blast and once you get the hang of it provides a great resource for creating quick websites.  However, connecting to the API was a bit of a challenge *at first*.  I figured out how to connect, create the text for the API response, and created an **IF** statement for if an activity wasn't selected then it directs to select from the drop-down menu.

Some key code that helped me was the `scripts.js` script:

I'm sure I can do some _refactoring_ once I learn more in the coming months at my [Coding Dojo](http://www.codingdojo.com) bootcamp.
